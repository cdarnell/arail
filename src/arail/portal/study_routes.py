"""Study surface — the tutor team's quiz bench.

Registered in ``portal/app.py`` as ``app.include_router(study_router)`` —
kept in its own module (the wiki_routes/world_routes pattern) so app.py
stays navigable.

## What a "coach" is

A coach is any agent folder under ``lab/pkb/agents/`` whose ``AGENT.md``
frontmatter declares a ``deck``, and whose loaded instance implements the
three-method drill protocol:

    session() -> dict | None      # the next due card, with its answer
    record(card_id, correct)      # grade it; drives spaced review
    cards() -> list[dict]         # the whole deck (for the progress count)

That is the entire contract. Nothing here knows about algebra or about any
particular book — a new subject coach appears on this page the moment its
folder exists, with no change to this file. The reference implementation is
the shared body at ``lab/pkb/agents/_tutor_kit/tutor_kit.py``.

## Why the duck-typing is guarded

``loader.load_one`` returns whatever singleton an agent folder exports, and
most agents (Buddy, SRE, the Debt Advisor) are not coaches at all. Every
call site here checks the protocol with ``_as_coach`` before touching an
instance, so a non-coach agent can never be invoked by this surface — and a
half-written coach degrades to "not on the page" rather than to a 500.

Security: ``POST /api/study/grade`` carries the same CSRF envelope as the
rest of the portal's writes. It is also the only write here, and the only
thing it can change is a Leitner box number in the agent's own state.json.

Honesty: this surface renders *only* what the coach hands it — a card
authored by a human, and an explanation read from a sealed World bundle. No
endpoint in this module calls a model. If a coach has nothing due, the page
says so instead of inventing a question.
