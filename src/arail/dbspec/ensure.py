"""Atlas-free, codegen-free replay of the committed migration ledger.

``./arailctl db apply`` (see ``arail.dbspec.cli``/``atlas``) is a developer
tool: it shells out to the ``atlas`` binary, generates a new migration file
into ``spec/schema/migrations/``, lints it, and regenerates code into the
source tree. A user who clones the repo and runs ``./arailctl setup`` has
none of that installed and must never need it (Assumption 1,
sprints/2026-08-10-arail2-persistence-instantiated/ARCHITECTURE.md).

This module is the seamless path instead: it replays the already-committed,
already-lint-gated migration files in ``spec/schema/migrations/`` into a
per-data-dir SQLite file, using ``PRAGMA user_version`` as the applied-
migration cursor (Assumption 4 — invisible to ``atlas schema diff``, so it
adds no drift against ``spec/schema/schema.hcl``). It never authors a
migration, never invokes ``atlas``, never runs codegen, and never touches
Lance reconciliation or the 1.x->2.0 import — those stay behind their own
explicit verbs (§4.2 of ARCHITECTURE.md).

The safe/lossy line (§4.2) — ALLOWLIST, not a denylist (REVIEW.md BLOCK-1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A denylist cannot fail closed: "fail closed" means "anything I cannot
prove safe is LOSSY," and a denylist's default is the opposite — anything
it doesn't happen to name is (wrongly) SAFE-FORWARD. An earlier version of
this module was exactly that (six regex patterns) and had four verified
executable bypasses: ``ALTER TABLE t DROP c`` (no ``COLUMN`` keyword —
the idiomatic short form, and the single most likely destructive
migration anyone actually writes), ``REPLACE INTO``, ``INSERT OR REPLACE
INTO``, ``UPDATE OR REPLACE``, plus ``DROP VIEW``/``DROP TRIGGER``. All
four are real, data-destroying SQLite that the denylist waved through.

The classifier now works the other way. Every statement in a migration
file (split via ``_split_statements``) is checked against an explicit
ALLOWLIST of leading keywords — ``CREATE TABLE``, ``CREATE [UNIQUE]
INDEX``, ``CREATE VIEW``, ``CREATE TRIGGER``, ``ALTER TABLE … ADD
COLUMN``, and bare ``INSERT INTO`` (no ``OR REPLACE``/``OR IGNORE``/any
other modifier between ``INSERT`` and ``INTO``) — and classified
SAFE-FORWARD only if it matches. **Everything else, including anything
this classifier does not recognize at all, is LOSSY.** A statement
prefixed by a comment (so the allowlist regex doesn't match at position
0) is also LOSSY — a false positive is acceptable; a false negative is
not, and this now actually holds (test 5 exercises the four verified
bypasses above plus additional adversarial cases, all correctly LOSSY).
A migration file is SAFE-FORWARD only if every one of its statements is;
one non-allowlisted statement anywhere makes the whole file LOSSY.

Ledger verification (§4.2) — REQUIRED before executing anything (BLOCK-2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before any migration's SQL is executed (``apply=True``) — and reported
by ``apply=False`` too, so ``status``/``doctor`` catch it as early as
``start`` would — every committed migration file in
``spec/schema/migrations/`` is verified against ``spec/schema/migrations/
atlas.sum``'s own per-file hash. Atlas's digest is **not** undocumented
or binary-only, contrary to an earlier draft of this module's reasoning:
it is ``base64(sha256(filename_bytes + file_content_bytes))``, reproduced
here in pure Python with no ``atlas`` binary (verified byte-for-byte
against the real ``atlas.sum`` in this repo). A file missing from the
ledger, or whose hash disagrees with what's recorded, makes the whole
call ``state="diverged"`` and executes zero statements — this is the
actual precondition for auto-executing SQL at boot, not a follow-up.

This is a *second*, complementary check to the sidecar below, not a
replacement for it: ``atlas.sum`` only proves a file matches what was
committed to *this checkout*; it says nothing about whether the file
this DB already applied is the same bytes it applied last time (a
tampered-then-reverted file, or a DB moved between checkouts at
different commits, could match today's ``atlas.sum`` while having
silently changed what got executed against this specific database).

Post-apply divergence (the sidecar)
-------------------------------------
The first time this module applies a migration file, it records a plain
sha256 of that file's bytes in a JSON sidecar next to the database
(``<data_dir>/.arail_ensure_state.json`` — the same pattern the
vector-index provenance sidecar already uses elsewhere in this codebase).
Every later call re-hashes the file and compares against what it
recorded. A mismatch is DIVERGED. This catches "someone edited an
already-applied migration file" — a fact about *this database's own
history* that ``atlas.sum`` alone cannot express, since ``atlas.sum``
only ever describes the current state of the checkout, not what a given
database has already executed.

Write discipline (contract, §4.1)
----------------------------------
``apply=False`` performs **zero writes**: no file creation, no directory
creation, no PRAGMA writes, no ``sqlite3.connect(path)`` in the mode that
would create a missing file. ``status`` and ``doctor`` use only this mode.
This is the exact bug a previous sprint shipped in a read-only check; do
not reintroduce it (see the module test ``test_apply_false_is_write_free``
in ``tests/test_dbspec_ensure.py``, which snapshots the directory tree
before/after).

    can detect "did not come up clean" without parsing prose.

    all — a stripped-down fork per ``BLUEPRINTS.md``, the feature simply
    doesn't apply here) is deliberately excluded from the degrading set,
