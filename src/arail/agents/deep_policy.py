"""Throttle-aware deep-inference policy for the built-in agents.

Centralises one decision: *should this agent call run on the aeroLLM "2nd
inference" (deep backend), or the fast on-GPU model?* — and owns the single
shared deep ``ModelRouter`` so the lab never holds two resident copies (double
residency is an OOM on the target hardware).

Policy, in order:
  • Gated to the ``maximus`` tier (the only tier that ships aeroLLM) and an
    importable ``aerollm_api``; otherwise always fast.
  • Foreground calls (a user is waiting) may use deep immediately.
  • Background calls (proactive agent chatter, reflection, research) use deep
    only when it is *non-intrusive*: not halted, outside the active window, no
    operator presence, the runtime profile allows it, and Metal memory
    pressure is below a gentle background ceiling.
  • Any deep failure (including OOM) transparently falls back to fast.

Kept dependency-light and side-effect-free so it unit-tests without loading
real model weights. All heavy imports are lazy and inside functions.
