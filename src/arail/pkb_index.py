"""PKB incremental index — in-process debounced upsert into LanceDB.

Public API
----------
ensure_ready(pkb_root)   — Call once at portal startup. Checks the pkb_pages
                           table schema and runs a bounded staleness sweep.
                           Triggers index_all() if the table is missing or
                           schema-mismatched (dimension mismatch never drops
                           the table — see C2/FM12).
schedule_upsert(path)    — Enqueue a path for upsert. Safe to call from any
                           thread; the write helper never blocks. Debounce
                           window is LAB_PKB_UPSERT_DEBOUNCE_SEC (default 2s),
                           or the error back-off (60s) while degraded.
embedding_status()       — (ok, message) for the embedding subsystem. ok is
                           False while any degraded code is set (C1).
set_degraded(code, reason) — Mark ONE cause degraded. Codes: "provider"
                           (embed call failed), "dimension" (table's vector
                           width disagrees with the spec), "provenance"
                           (sidecar disagrees with the spec), "empty" (no
                           rows yet). REVIEW2.md BLOCK-1: these are
                           independent facts. A successful embed call only
                           proves the *provider* is reachable — it must
                           NEVER clear "dimension"/"provenance"/"empty",
                           which are facts about the table, not the network.
clear_degraded(code=None) — Clear one cause (evidence about THAT cause
                           only), or every cause (code=None — used only
                           after a full rebuild, which is evidence about
                           all of them at once: index_all/pkb_reembed).
degraded_codes()         — dict of the currently active codes -> reasons.
                           Callers that need to know WHICH cause (not just
                           whether something is wrong — e.g. doctor's
                           exit-code decision) use this instead of parsing
                           embedding_status()'s prose.
check_read_path_health(table, db_path) — C4 enforcement ON THE READ PATH,
                           not just at ensure_ready/startup: dimension then
                           provenance, both required before a query is
                           served as semantic. Sets/clears "dimension"/
                           "provenance" as a side effect. Called by
                           pkb._semantic_search on EVERY search.
_reset_for_tests()       — Reset module-level state between tests. Not for
                           production use.

Design notes
------------
* threading.Timer — not asyncio — so this module works from sync helpers,
  async portal handlers, and CLI entrypoints without requiring a running
  event loop. Deliberately diverges from wiki.py's asyncio debouncer.
* One threading.Lock serializes all state mutations and the merge_insert call.
* The file write is NEVER blocked by indexing. Every schedule_upsert call
  in the write helpers is wrapped in try/except Exception: pass.
* merge_insert upsert path (LanceDB ≥ 0.5). Falls back to delete+add if
  merge_insert is absent on a pinned env.
* Path safety: paths outside pkb_root are rejected via relative_to().
* C1 error contract (ARCHITECTURE.md): an embedding outage must be
  impossible to mistake for an empty corpus. Every call site that can
  trigger a network embed call catches ``arail.dbspec.embed.EmbeddingError``
  *separately* from every other exception: logs at ERROR (not WARNING),
  emits an ``activity_log`` event at severity "error", and sets the module
  degraded flag via ``set_degraded()``. Non-embedding exceptions keep the
  original WARNING behaviour — those are the SKIP/DEGRADE classes, not LOUD.
* Reason-scoped degraded state (REVIEW2.md BLOCK-1, fixed here): the
  degraded flag used to be one module-global bool covering five unrelated
  facts, so a successful search (which only proves the *provider* is
  reachable) was clearing a standing dimension/provenance warning and
  ``doctor`` would report "ok" while semantic search silently returned
  nothing forever. Every ``set_degraded``/``clear_degraded`` call below
  names the specific code it has evidence about.
