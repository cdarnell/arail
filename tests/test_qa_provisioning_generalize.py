"""QA target 7: does ``arail/provisioning.py`` generalize, or does it
hardcode the three known bugs?

ARCHITECTURE.md §5 makes the strong claim:

    declared and not instantiated => a finding, never silence.
    ... Adding a mechanism to ARAIL 2.1 without registering an assertion
    should feel like an omission — the registry is the checklist.

The sprint's own test 31 registers a synthetic "instance four" and asserts
doctor reports it. That proves the *registry* dispatches. It does not prove
the *rule* holds for a mechanism shaped differently from the three the module
was written around. This file tries to construct mechanisms that slip past.

Three do. They are reported as QA findings; each has its assertion written
against the CORRECT behaviour and is expected to fail until fixed.
