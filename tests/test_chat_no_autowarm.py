"""Chat page load must never auto-trigger a model load.

`autoWarmBoxes()` used to fire automatically on every /chat page visit
via `queueMicrotask()`: it warmed Box A unconditionally, and — if it
judged conditions "eligible" (tier + installed + not opted out + enough
free RAM) — silently turned Compare ON and loaded a second, heavy deep-
backend model (aeroLLM/AirLLM) with zero user action. This is almost
certainly what made the aeroLLM "2nd chat box" load a misconfigured
model and freeze the whole event loop before the operator had ever
touched Compare — the exact same "unsolicited post-boot activity"
category the operator explicitly ruled out for the cold-start overlay
(_boot_overlay.html, which replaced an /api/ready-polling implementation
for the identical reason).

Removed. `send()` doesn't need a prior warm: it posts straight to
/api/chat/stream, and the backend (Ollama, or whichever runtime is
selected) cold-loads on first request the same way it always would —
the only change is that cost is now paid honestly, inline, on the
user's first real message, not invisibly before they've done anything.
