# The 54 red tests — what they actually are

## Why this exists

Running the suite the way `CONTRIBUTING.md:54` tells you to —
`python -m pytest` — produces **54 failures out of 5,654** on a clean
checkout. That number is worse than useless: a contributor cannot tell
their breakage from the standing breakage, so the suite has stopped
being a tripwire. H0 is the proof. The tuning loop's headline behaviour
was broken in a way one real `git add` would have caught, and the red it
would have shown up in was already ignored.

## The headline: most of it isn't broken product

**33 of the 54 failures pass when their file is run on its own.** They
are cross-test pollution — state leaking from an earlier test in the
same process — not defects in the code they point at.

Method: extract every failing file from a full `-p no:randomly` run, then
run each file standalone and compare.

| Class | Failures | What it means |
|---|---:|---|
| **Pollution victims** — file passes alone | **33** | Not a product bug. The test is fine, the code is fine, an earlier test left the process dirty. |
| **Genuine** — still fails alone | **21** | Real: a stale assertion, a drifted contract, or an actual defect. |

Files that pass in isolation and fail in the suite:

```
test_r1_r3_chat_models (4)      test_w9_embedder_swap (3)
test_loader_skills_only_agents (3)  test_aerollm_model_ready (3)
test_build_qkz_corpus (2)       test_deep_default_and_tier (2)
test_model_ux_phase0_warmth_probe (2)
test_qa_model_ux_memory_and_eject_fidelity (2)
test_qa_provider_dropdown_paranoid (2)
test_aerollm_compute_source (1) test_autochecks_boot (1)
test_model_separation (1)       test_models_settle_endpoint (1)
test_onboarding (1)             test_recap_core (1)
test_runtime_profile_api (1)    test_b1_cloud_gallery_contract (1)
```

The victims cluster hard around one surface: `/api/chat/models` and the
model-readiness payload. The failures read as a contract regression —
`KeyError: 'optional_backends'`, `'deep'`, `'compact'`, `'kwargs'`,
"Legacy branch dropped keys: {onboarding, slots, switchable, …}" — which
is exactly the trap. Those keys are all present in `src/`, and every one
of those tests passes alone. **Nothing is missing from the API.** Anyone
triaging by reading the assertion message would go hunting a regression
that does not exist.

## Genuinely failing standalone (21)

These deserve individual judgement; none is diagnosed here beyond its
error, and some are near-certainly stale tests rather than live bugs.

| File | n | Error |
|---|---:|---|
| `portal/test_build_tab.py` | 4 | `404` where `200`/`409` expected — routes gone or tier-gated |
| `test_aerollm_defaults.py` | 4 | `KeyError: 'kwargs'` |
| `test_dashboard_layout_v2.py` | 2 | Mission Status card is `class="card full"`, test wants `card` |
| `test_reset_stop_scope.py` | 2 | temp-dir/port assertions |
| `test_swarm_goal_surfaces.py` | 2 | "Draft Swarm Plan" absent from dashboard + research HTML |
| `portal/test_models_api.py` | 1 | status `unknown` not in the allowed set |
| `portal/test_opencode_config_lifecycle.py` | 1 | `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` missing from Popen env |
| `portal/test_opencode_lifecycle.py` | 1 | log not rotated to `.log.1` |
| `portal/test_token_compliance.py` | 1 | design-token ratchet |
| `test_cache_prewarm.py` | 1 | prompt text drifted |
| `test_dac_rename.py` | 1 | nav `class="active"` |
| `test_instance_isolation_audit.py` | 1 | `hardware.py` re-reads `ARAIL_DATA_DIR`, breaking A32.1's single-exception rule |
| `test_instance_ports.py` | 1 | `8110 != 8100` |
| `test_model_hosting_reframe_qa.py` | 1 | backend must `RuntimeError` on the sentinel |
| `test_shell_source_safety.py` | 1 | **in CI's `dac-feature-tests` list** — so that workflow is red, or this is machine-dependent |

`test_instance_isolation_audit` is the one I would look at first: it is
an architectural guard, it names a specific offender (`hardware.py`), and
a guard that has been red long enough to be ignored is worse than no
guard.

## Why it got this bad: nothing runs the whole suite

Three workflows exist, and each runs a hand-picked file list:

- `dac-feature-tests.yml` — ~22 named files
- `db-ensure-ci.yml` — ~7 named files
- `blueprint-smoke.yml` — `tests/test_imports.py`

There is no Makefile, no full-suite script, and no job that enumerates
`tests/`. A test not on one of those lists can rot forever without
anyone seeing it. Meanwhile `CONTRIBUTING.md` tells humans to run the
whole thing.

That gap is the actual defect. The 54 are a symptom.

## Recommended order

1. **Find and fix the polluter** — highest leverage by a wide margin,
   and the suite cannot be CI-gated until it is done. **Not found. See
   the investigation below for what is ruled out**, so the next person
   doesn't repeat it.
2. **Then gate it.** Add a full-suite CI job. Doing this before (1) just
   institutionalises the red.
3. **Then work the 21** individually, starting with
   `test_instance_isolation_audit`.

Do not "fix" pollution victims by loosening their assertions. They are
correct; the process they run in is not.

## The polluter hunt — what is ruled out

Not solved. Recorded so the next attempt starts here rather than at the
beginning.

**Reproduction.** Deterministic, no random ordering involved:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest $(sed -n '1,283p' order.txt) \
  "tests/test_r1_r3_chat_models.py::test_r1_empty_provider_param_goes_to_legacy_branch" \
  -q -p no:randomly
```

where `order.txt` is the collection order from `--collect-only`. The
victim fails there and passes standalone, every time.

**Ruled out:**

| Hypothesis | Test | Result |
|---|---|---|
| One bad file | Each of the 9 × 32-file chunks + victim | **every chunk clean** |
| Something in the first half | files 1–141 + victim | clean |
| Something in the second half | files 142–283 + victim | clean |
| A live-Ollama probe degrading under load | victim with `OLLAMA_HOST` at a dead port, and with `ARAIL_SKIP_OLLAMA=1` | **passes both ways** — the payload does not depend on the probe |

**What the shape implies.** No 32-file window and neither half alone
reproduces it, but the union of the halves does. So it is not a single
polluting file. Two candidates remain:

1. **A pair split across the halves** — file A in 1–141 and file B in
   142–283, each harmless alone. This is the likeliest, and it is
   findable: hold all of half 1 fixed and bisect half 2 to isolate B,
   then hold B fixed and bisect half 1 for A. Budget ~8 runs of 4–6
   minutes.
2. **An accumulation threshold** — a module-level dict, an `lru_cache`,
   or repeated FastAPI startup/shutdown that only misbehaves past some
   count. `CLAUDE.md` flags a real instance of this shape: `pkb_index`'s
   degraded-state tracking (`_degraded_codes`, `_pending`,
   `_initialized_roots`, `_pkb_root_cache`) is **process-global, not
   per-root**, and is only safe because one process serves one PKB root.
   A suite runs hundreds of roots through one process. That is the first
   place I would look.

Distinguishing them is cheap: rerun the full prefix with the *first
half shuffled*. A pair-based cause usually survives; a count-based one
always does.

## Caveats

- Counts are from a single `-p no:randomly` run. With random ordering an
  earlier run showed **60** failures — the extra 6 are further pollution,
  which is corroboration, not noise.
- `test_dashboard_layout_v2` fails **2** standalone but **1** in the full
  suite: pollution can mask a failure as well as cause one.
- Environment matters and is not fully separated here: this machine has
  no `transformers` and no MLX, and has a live Ollama with
  `ai-engineer:latest` installed. Some of the 21 may be machine-shaped
  rather than broken — `test_model_separation` reads real local Ollama
  state, for instance. A clean-machine run would sharpen the split.
