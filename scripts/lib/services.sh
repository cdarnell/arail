# scripts/lib/services.sh — root-lab per-service readiness probing
# (sprints/2026-07-29-elite-cli/ARCHITECTURE.md §8.1).
#
# Boundary (load-bearing, do not blur): scripts/lib/instances.sh owns the
# World-instance registry and instance/daemon LIVENESS and remains the
# single source of truth for both. THIS file owns root-lab per-service
# READINESS probing — a thing instances.sh has never implemented. It must
# never re-derive daemon or instance liveness, and it must never grow a
# second `_port_in_use` — it obtains that from instances.sh's
# `inst_load_port_helpers` (which extracts the real one from setup.sh).
#
# Sourced (never executed) by scripts/start.sh and arailctl. Callers must
# set REPO_ROOT and source scripts/lib/instances.sh first (for
# inst_load_port_helpers) — this file does not source instances.sh itself
# to avoid a second copy of the "guard every source" discipline; callers
# already guard it (A2/F4).
#
# bash 3.2 only: no associative arrays, no readarray/mapfile, no
# ${var,,}/${var^^}, no local -n / declare -A. Every function here is
# `$( )`-safe under `set -euo pipefail` and never aborts the caller — a
# missing tool (curl/lsof/ss) is reported as a distinct "undetectable"
# state, never as "down" (A4, F30). No function here ever calls
# kill/pkill/pgrep (T31) or touches the instance registry or secrets.env
# (T30) — this file only ever reads loopback HTTP/TCP state.
