// ARAIL 2.0 model registry — compiled to a generated Python registry.
//
// The generated registry is the ONLY resolution path. No call site resolves
// a model any other way.
//
// HARD CEILING: no model at or above 8B parameters may serve as the
// answering model. No escalation, no override flag, no fallback exception.
// The ceiling is enforced at COMPILE time — a spec that violates it fails to
// build. That is the whole point of putting it here rather than in a runtime
// check that a caller can forget or bypass.
//
// Parameter counts are sourced from the GGUF header or the published config
// metadata. Filenames are NEVER trusted: "7b" in a filename is marketing, not
// a measurement. Every model declares `parameter_source` naming where its
// count came from, and `./arailctl db doctor` re-verifies declared counts
// against the GGUF header for any model actually present on disk.
//
// If a parameter count cannot be determined with confidence, declare
// `parameter_count = -1`. The model is then ineligible for every role and the
// build says so by name.

// unambiguous.

// overlap dressed up as semantic search. nomic-embed-text is served through
